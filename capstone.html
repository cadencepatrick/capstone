                    He works in total silence, using a braille stylus to sketch outlines of his drawings. 
                    He "sees" with his fingers--he understands the shape of an object by feeling it, and translates that feeling to the canvas.

                <li class="list">He participated in a 2004 University of Toronto study by John M. Kennedy that proved
                    a person who was born blind can develop normally without seeing the outside world.

                <li class="list">Armağan has had his work displayed in Türkiye,
